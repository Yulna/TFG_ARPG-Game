# Chambers of Elrankat

This is a repository for the Code files in my end of degree project.

**ATTENTION:** This project will not work if you download it, it's mostly for me to have the Code files and possible basic materials at hand, most of the artistic assets were bought and so I cannot upload them.

# Intro

Chambers of Elrankat is a prototype for a diablo-like game, the aim of this work is to have a player able to equip multiple skills, as well as equip items which change the player stats en the skill behaviour or damage.

Note that itâ€™s a prototype to test functionality, there has been no work done to make this prototype balanced or fun, use of cheats to test the various aspects of the prototype is encouraged.

# Controls 

 - Move your character by clicking anywhere on the map with the LMB     
 - Use 1-2-3-4-RMB to use skills     
 - Basic attack is used with LMB if you are in melee range of an enemy or by using left shift + LMB     
 - Press S to open the skill menu     
 - Press I to open inventory, equip/unequip items with RMB, throw items with ctrl+LMB     
 - Press C to open character stats
